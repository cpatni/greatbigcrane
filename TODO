* Trash projects
    * I added a delete, but we don't have trash yet
* Write helper for seeing if a section is in parts
* Create a bunch of git repos with different buildout setups in them for easy testing
* Improve about page and make it a help file/readme
* Figure out how to edit the buildout section (not a recipe)

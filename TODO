* Trash projects
    * I added a delete, but we don't have trash yet
* Add support for list-based interface for extra_paths
* Write helper for seeing if a section is in parts
* Create a bunch of git repos with different buildout setups in them for easy testing
* Improve about page and make it a help file/readme
* fix up the dict methods on recipes to be less breaky and duplicaty (Jason)
* Figure out how to edit the buildout section (not a recipe)

* Write helper for seeing if a section is in parts
* Create a bunch of git repos with different buildout setups in them for easy testing
* Figure out how to edit the buildout section (not a recipe)
* Move recipe templates out of project directory
* Ensure that notifications show up ajaxy on project page if there are currently no notifications for that project (It looks like no, but I didn't look too close)

Phil:
* Possibly include RTE on description fields

* Trash projects
    * I added a delete, but we don't have trash yet
* Write helper for seeing if a section is in parts
* Create a bunch of git repos with different buildout setups in them for easy testing
* Figure out how to edit the buildout section (not a recipe)
* bootstrap button on project page

Phil:
* Possibly include RTE on description fields
* Notification page should have a link back to the project
* Bootstrap icon on project page
* Style notifications page
* Style project view page

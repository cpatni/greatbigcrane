<p>
Great Big Crane allows managing python buildouts and django projects.
Unlike many django applications, it is designed to be run on a local secured
environment. This allows it to be extremely responsive and dispense with user
authentication.
</p>
<p>
In normal usage, Great Big Crane allows you to manage a collection of projects
in a specific code directory. This directory name is set on the preferences
page. For example, I store my code in <code>/home/dusty/code/</code> and individual
projects are in <code>/home/dusty/code/greatbigcrane/</code> or
<code>/home/dusty/code/whohasmy/</code>. The projects are expected to contain a
standard buildout structure with a <code>buildout.cfg</code> and
<code>bootstrap.py</code>. Great Big Crane can introspect existing directories
and buildouts in this format or it can help set up brand new buildouts.
</p>
<p>
To see it in action, click the Projects button on the menu bar and then click the
<a href="{% url add_project %}">Add Project</a> button to add a new project. This
simple form allows you to enter the name, base directory, an
optional git repository and description. The base directory is automatically
populated from the directory preference and the name of the project, however
you are free to change this for code in non-standard locations.
</p>
<p>
If you provided a git repository, it will automatically clone the repository into
the new working directory. Otherwise, it will initialize and boostrap a simple
skeleton buildout in that directory. Both the clone and bootstrap actions are
processed in an external job queue, and notifications will show up on your
dashboard when they have completed.
</p>
<p>The dashboard lists your most recently active projects and explicitly
favourited projects. Projects can be favourited using the star icon in the
project list. You can also schedule a buildout and tests from the dashboard.
Tests are run through the buildout. The test icon will glow either red or
green depending on whether or not the last set of tests for that project
completed successfully or not.
</p>
<p>
Notifications indicate the output of various asynchronous commands, and come
in three flavours: success, failure, or general. The small "x" box
on the right of a notification allows you to dismiss it. The notifications
page allows you to visually review all recent notifications and is set up
so you can spatially see notifications in both chronological order and sorted
by status (success, general, failure) at the same time. Clicking the notification
allows you to view the output of the command that was run.
</p>
<p>
If you click the project's row, you can see the buildout configuration
for that project, with some helpers to edit the buildout. This
information is introspected from the buildout.cfg itself, so if you
want to edit it directly in your text editor, you can. We have provided
a nifty line editor for editing key value pairs in sections such as
eggs or extra paths that often have multiple lines. Certain expansions
are available for quickly referring to other sections (e.g. <code>eggs =
${buildout:eggs}</code>).
</p>
<p>
The sidebar on project lists not only displays non-dismissed
notifications for the project, but also a set of actions that can be
executed on that project, mostly asynchronously through the job queue:
you can edit a project's details or delete it; you can run buildout on
the project or bootstrap the buildout; you can run the test suite; if
the project has a git repo, you can issue a git pull to update it; if it
is a github project, you can view the github page to review commits and
issues; if it is a django project, you can run syncdb and migrate.
